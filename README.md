- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Mayuresh Patel and I am a university student at Middle Georgia State University pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology with a concentration in Software Engineering. I enjoy designing and creating software systems using a wide array of programming languages and tools. My goal is to use my skills to create systems to be used in real-world scenarios that aid in making our lives easier.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m primarily interested in Back-End development using my preferred languages including Java, C/C++, and C#. However, I also enjoy working on creating aesthetically pleasing yet highly functional UI/UX.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C development and the intiricacies of the C language.
